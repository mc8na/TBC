To run the programs, execute the commands "python3 sequence.py" and "python3 car_simulator.py" in the proper folder in your Terminal window. The sequence.py program generates two graphs comparing the empirical data for the time complexity of the solution to fitted linear and quadratic models, while the car_simulator.py program generates a graph of the vehicle trajectory as well as a graph of the longitudinal and lateral accelerations of the vehicle over time.
